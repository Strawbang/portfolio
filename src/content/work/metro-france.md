### Revolutionizing Product Development at METRO France

<p>During my tenure at METRO France as a Full-Stack Software Engineer, I initiated transformative changes that revolutionized product development.</p>

<p>I implemented uniform technologies, architectures, and processes across products, resulting in an incredible 80% acceleration in product creation. This involved leveraging a sophisticated tech stack that included Scrum, GCP, Kubernetes, GitHub Action, Typescript, React, Node.js, TypeORM, and GraphQL, ensuring seamless integration.<p>

<p>One of the significant milestones was the development of an innovative employee bonus management product. This not only reduced staff turnover across 93 warehouses but also improved operational efficiency and customer experiences on a nationwide scale.<p>

<p>My contributions have centered on streamlining operations, enhancing products, and fostering a positive work environment for both employees and customers at METRO France.<p>
