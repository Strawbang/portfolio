### Driving Digital Transformation at Fokal Studio

<p>During my tenure as a Full-Stack Software Engineer at Fokal Studio, I led transformative initiatives that reshaped digital landscapes.</p>

<p>My focus on developing client websites significantly enhanced their online presence and engagement by 20%.</p>
<p>Noteworthy projects included the transformation of a French school of excellence using vanilla PHP and a Headless Directus CMS, resulting in a substantial increase in student attraction.</p>

<p>Innovation was at the forefront, especially when developing a private invitation list system for a high-profile restaurant launch. This solution showcased the tangible impact of technological advancements on business success, highlighting the potential for digital solutions to drive significant outcomes.</p>
