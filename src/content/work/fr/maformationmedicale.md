### Transforming UI/UX and Development at Ma Formation Médicale

<p>As a Full-Stack Software Engineer at Ma Formation Médicale, my focus was on elevating the user experience and optimizing development processes.</p>

</p>Transitioning from PHP to JavaScript marked a significant turning point, resulting in a remarkable 40% improvement in application performance and a 30% increase in code maintainability.</p>
</p>Introducing a component-based architecture further enhanced scalability and agility in development.</p>
</p>We also emphasized improving code readability, contributing to a more efficient and maintainable codebase.</p>

</p>Moreover, the implementation of a robust DevOps infrastructure using Docker Swarm, Portainer, Jenkins, and Traefik resulted in impressive monthly productivity savings, reshaping the development landscape at Ma Formation Médicale.</p>
