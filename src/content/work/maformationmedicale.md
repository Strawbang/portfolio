### Understanding old architecture and context

I've just joined the company as a trainee and I'm trying to understand the development produced by the previous developer.
Unfortunately this was done rather quickly.
Using php/symfony and production with filezilla.
It was very easy for me to understand the context: "offering training courses to healthcare professionals and offering training organisations the opportunity to place their advertisements on the site".

### Goal and training

I convinced my colleague to trust me, so I took the lead on the project.
I offered him a weekend to make a prototype and I'll be back with it at the start of the week.
I offered to help him improve his skills in javascript, react, nodejs and devops.
So I decided to start by working on the prototype, which was convincing.
I had a 1 year and 3 month contract with them and I promised him that before I left the product would be in production and that he would be able to maintain it.

### Final

I set up a component-based architecture for the backend and frontend and a CI/CD for the application deployment.
I used nodejs, react, sequelize, bootstrap, swarm, docker and jenkins.
