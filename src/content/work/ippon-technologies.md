### Spearheading Legacy Modernization at Ippon Technologies

<p>As a Full-Stack Software Engineer at Ippon Technologies since November 2025, I lead internal R&D initiatives to accelerate legacy modernization for strategic clients.</p>

<p>I developed an AI-Driven Modernization CLI in Rust, leveraging Tree-sitter for AST parsing and RAG for automated legacy code documentation — enabling teams to understand and migrate complex codebases faster than ever.</p>

<p>I implemented agentic workflows using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), creating autonomous testing agents and refactoring assistants that interact directly with IDEs and codebases to automate repetitive modernization tasks.</p>

<p>These initiatives significantly enhanced developer experience, reducing onboarding time on legacy projects by providing interactive "Chat with Code" capabilities for engineers joining complex systems.</p>
